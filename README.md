# cognitev

so i programmed a web server using flask made a database and a frontend to take info from companies
/home : a basic frontend to put info inside our db
/bar_chart: not completed as i failed to properly use chart.js to view the chart even tho i got the data needed correctly on the server side

how to run:
3 ways either you 
cd to the folder and pip install then python app.py
open in any ide and run
or use my dockerfile to make a docker container of the project (will take time if the internet is slow)
